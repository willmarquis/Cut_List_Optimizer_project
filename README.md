# Cut_List_Optimizer_project

## What is this project?

I often found myself wanting to optimize the use of my raw materials for small DIY projects. I found a few sites on the internet that did the trick, but some sites had features that others did not. While using it I also thought about a few things that could be added, so i decided that I would try to take all the things I liked from various sites and the new things i thought of and bring them together.
